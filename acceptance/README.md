We have assigned the following three tasks
for accepting your position into the program.

## Objective

Get you familiar with collaborative work
using version control software (in this case, git).

## Tasks

Leetcode challenge numbers:
12 - integer to roman
13 - roman to integer
71 - simplify path

## Resources

- [MIT Missing Semester Coursework on Version Control](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/version-control/)
- [Gajabaar Mentor's presentation on git](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NrNdBcl2kWSPyZxURVZ6eSmdB4hfbwru?usp=sharing)

## Submission

Once you have finished the task, 
you will need to send us the pull request with your work.
Sending in the pull request is the way to ensure that
your work gets visibility from the mentors, as well as
making sure your work is documented on your end and on 
our end.

To send in the pull request, you can view the main README.md
document on this same repository. For this task, 
your pull request must have the following three files:
- acceptance/<github-id>/12-integer-to-roman.c
- acceptance/<github-id>/13-roman-to-integer.c
- acceptance/<github-id>/71-simplify-path.c

Extra tips:
- .c part will change as per your choice of language.
- the final question is optional.
- ideally, you would use the same name for discord server, 
email communications, and github-id submissions here.
