# Natas

Natas is a wargame hosted by [OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/natas/). It is a beginner level wargame and is a great way to get started with web application security. The goal of the game is to find the password for the next level, which is stored in `/etc/natas_webpass/natasX`, where X is the level number. The password for level X+1 is in the file `/etc/natas_webpass/natasX+1` and so on.

I have written a blog post on notion.so about my experience with Natas. You can read it [here](https://axyut.notion.site/axyut/Natas-89872979425442318ff4173bd7161a8c).
Blog post is still a work in progress and it will be updated as I progress through the game. Writeups includes photos of the challenges and the solutions.
