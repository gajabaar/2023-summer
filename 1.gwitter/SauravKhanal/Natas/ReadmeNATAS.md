<h1>Natas</h1>
 Natas is a web-based wargame that provides a platform for individuals to learn and practice their skills in web security and penetration testing. The challenges are designed to test and improve participants' abilities to identify and exploit common web application vulnerabilities.

The challenges in Natas are presented as levels, with each level having its own unique web application to analyze and exploit. Participants are required to solve each level's puzzle by finding a vulnerability or a security flaw in the web application and then exploiting it to retrieve a hidden password.

<h1>OpenVAS Scan Report</h1>

OpenVAS (Open Vulnerability Assessment System) is a full-featured open-source vulnerability scanner that is used to detect and assess security vulnerabilities in computer systems and networks. It is designed to identify potential weaknesses in the target environment, such as outdated software versions, misconfigurations, and other security issues that could be exploited by attackers.

<h1>REMOTE CODE EXECUTION (Book: Real World Bug Hunting)</h1>

It is a vulnerability in which an application uses without user-controlled input and without sanitizing it.If an application doesn't properly sanitize user-controlled input, it opens the door to a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability.Exploiting this vulnerability usually takes one of two approaches: executing shell commands or invoking functions within the programming language that the vulnerable application utilizes or relies on.

<h1>Server-side request forgery (SSRF) from Web Academy</h1>
Server-side request forgery (SSRF) is a critical web security vulnerability that enables attackers to manipulate a server-side application into sending requests to unintended destinations.
