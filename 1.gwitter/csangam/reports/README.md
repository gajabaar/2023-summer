## Week 1 - SQLite Essentials
The goal this week is to get working idea on what a database system is,
and how it works. For this, we have picked SQLite, primarily because
it's light-weight and easy to get up and running.

A database for Gwitter is designed and implemented. Files containing the
sql statements for creating the database `Gwitter.sql` and for populating the
database with data are created `data.sql`
